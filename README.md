<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

![Code Example](https://github.com/pedrozaalex/asimov-ts/blob/main/.github/code-example.png?raw=true)

### Built With

This section is actually mostly empty since I tried to keep the dependencies to a minimum. That said, there are some projects that made my life a lot easier:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [nanoid](https://github.com/ai/nanoid)
- [Nx](https://nx.dev/)

### Why?

Mostly, I wanted to experiment with some ideas I had about how to create a game engine. I also wanted to learn more about TypeScript and how to use it to create a library.

But also, I really like the idea of giving back to the community. God knows how much I've learned from the open source community. So I thought it would be nice to create something that could help others.

### Why the name?

First of all, I **love** Asimov's Foundation series. Seriously, go read it right now if you haven't already.

Secondly, Asimov created entire worlds with just a few words. I wanted to create a tiny engine that could be used to create games with just a few lines of code. So I thought the name was fitting and a nice tribute to the author.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

- Install pnpm folowing the instructions [here](https://pnpm.io/installation)

### Installation

1. Create new project if you haven't already. I like vite for this, but you can use whatever you want.

   ```sh
   pnpx create-vite my-project --template vanilla-ts
   ```

1. Install asimov-ts

   ```sh
   pnpm add @asimov-ts/core @asimov-ts/web
   ```

That's it! You can now start using the engine.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

Please refer to this [project](https://github.com/pedrozaalex/tiny_snek) to see how to use asimov-ts to create a sort of complete game.
